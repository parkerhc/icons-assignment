    <p>The disparity between rich teams and poor teams in Major League Baseball has long been a contentious issue in the sport. We sought to map how predictive a team's payroll was of their eventual record. We collected win totals and payrolls from
      each team
      over a five-year period, from the 2015-2019 regular seasons. Teams with blue circles overperformed their expected position based on payroll, whereas the red circles indicate teams that underperformed their spending. The size of the circle
      corresponds to the degree of the shift.</p>

    <p class="caption">Robert Ford, a professor of sports management at the University of Michigan, thinks there's more to success than spending. “When have we ever been satisfied that a simple relationship between one variable and another variable
      tells the whole story of the determination of winning?” Ford said in an <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/dont-be-fooled-by-baseballs-small-budget-success-stories/">interview</a> with fivethirtyeight.com. “What you really need to do
      is stop and think about what are all the other things: nothing about coaches, nothing about front office/GM
      acumen.” Our results would suggest Professor Ford was on to something.</p>
